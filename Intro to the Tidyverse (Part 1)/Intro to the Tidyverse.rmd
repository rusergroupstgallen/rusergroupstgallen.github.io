### Goals for this session

- Touch a little bit of everything by working live on a data set
- Know where to look for an answer if something is not immediately clear
- Important takeaway: Mastering the packages in the `tidyverse` alone takes years, it's completely normal to spend a large amount of time on stackoverflow looking for answers

.center[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/stackoverflow meme.png")
```
]

---

### Let's get settled in

Installing and loading the `tidyverse` which in turn loads all packages contained in it:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r, warning=F, results=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's get the data and touch one of the first components of the `tidyverse` at the same time:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

```{r, warning=F, message=F, results=F}
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

---

### The Pipe: `%>%`

The pipe from the package `magrittr` can be translated into **"take the thing from before and pipe it (put it) into what's coming after"**.

```{r}
penguins %>% summary()
```

---

### The Pipe: `%>%`

When working with many variables:

```{r}
penguins %>% glimpse()
```

---

### The Pipe's Major Advantage Is Readability

The pipe can make nested functions look much nicer and **easier to read**.

The code below shows how to calculate the **mean body weight for the species _Adelie_ by island** without the pipe ([Source](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/pipes/)):

```{r}
summarize(group_by(filter(penguins, species == "Adelie"), island), body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

### The Pipe's Major Advantage Is Readability

The same code using the pipe can be **written, executed, and read line by line**:

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

This is **much** easier to read.

---

### So let's read it line-by-line

```{r}
penguins %>% #<<
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Line-By-Line:

1. **Take `penguins` and (pass it on)**

---

### So let's read it line-by-line

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% #<<
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Line-By-Line:

1. Take `penguins` and (pass it on)
1. **Filter it so only species Adelie remains (and pass it on)**

---

### So let's read it line-by-line

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>% #<<
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Line-By-Line:

1. Take `penguins` and (pass it on)
1. Filter it so only species Adelie remains (and pass it on)
1. **Group the data by island (and pass it on)**

---

### So let's read it line-by-line

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

Line-By-Line:

1. Take `penguins` and (pass it on)
1. Filter it so only species Adelie remains (and pass it on)
1. Group the data by island (and pass it on)
1. **Create a summarised variable `body_mass` with `mean`**

---

### Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

The `filter` function will give you back what you ask it for. You can think about it as **including the observations matching your criterion**.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  print(n = 5)
```
---

### Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

`filter` replaces the native R equivalent...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie",]
```

...and makes it part of pipe chain.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

---

### Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

Another neat trick: `%in%`. You can give the criterion more species.

**It's your go**, please filter this data set. We **only** want to see the species:

- Adelie
- Gentoo

Some guidance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Species 1 here", "Species 2 here"))
```

--

Solution:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Adelie", "Gentoo"))
```

---

### Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

How do we know which species are in the data set?

Using the `count` function, which is really useful for categorical variables:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(species)
```

---

### Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

How do we know which species are in the data set?

You can also sort the results:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(species, sort = TRUE) #<<
```

---

### Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

If you want to exclude something, you need to use the `NOT` operator:

```{r}
TRUE
!TRUE
```

---

### Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

Just put it before your condition:

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!species %in% c("Chinstrap"))
```

Show everything that's **NOT** any of the values in the vector to the right.

```{r, echo=F}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!species %in% c("Chinstrap")) %>% 
  print(n = 5)
```

---

### Coming back to the example

The goal is to calculate **mean body mass for the species Adelie by island**.

```{r, echo=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

### What's `group_by()`?

It unlocks the ability to calculate a number for different categories:

We have **three islands**. 

```{r}
penguins %>% count(island, sort = T)
```

---

### `group_by()` and `summarise()`

Just summarising without grouping gives the **mean just for the species Adelie**.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

### `group_by()` and `summarise()`

Note that adding `na.rm = TRUE` is necessary to avoid running into errors when missing values are present. Observations with `NA` as values are discarded for the calculation, if `na.rm = TRUE` is specified.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

---

### `group_by()` and `summarise()`

So let's add it again. Now comes the magic. By adding the `group_by` argument, the **value is calculated across all different elements in the group**.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

`summarise` reduces the number of rows.

---

### `mutate()`

Summarise **collapsed the observations in each group** for our calculations. If we want to **preserve the same number of observations** and add a new column containing a value for each existing value, we have to use **`mutate`**.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  mutate(species = "Adelie") #<<
```

---

### It's your go

Please calculate the mean bodyweight for each species.

Instructions:

1. Group by the variable `species`
1. Use `summarise` to calculate a mean

### Solution:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

---

### It's your go

Please calculate the mean bodyweight for each species and each island (as a combination). 

Tip: You can **add more than one variable to the `group_by()` argument**.

<br>

.center[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}

---

### Solution:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island, species) %>% #<<
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

---

### It's your go

Please calculate the mean bodymass for each combination of species and sex.

---

### Hold on

.pull-left[

What is this?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

]

.center[.pull-right[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/afraid.png")
```


]]

---

### Hold on

.pull-left[

What is this?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

]

.pull-right[

**The NAs come from the `sex` variable.**

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(sex)
```

]

---

### `drop_na` and `select`

To solve this task, we need to take care of the `NA` values in the columns we are working with.

However, there is one problem:

**If we drop all rows with NA values in the whole data frame, we will delete too many rows!**

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.75, fig.width=7, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
colSums(is.na(penguins)) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  rename(missing = x) %>% 
  mutate(fill_cat = case_when(names %in% c("species", "sex") ~ "Yes",
                              TRUE ~ "No")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = missing, 
             y = names %>% reorder(missing),
             fill = fill_cat)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y = "Variable",
       x = "# of NAs",
       fill = "Variable used\nfor calculation in\nthis exercise?") +
  theme_light()
```

---

### `drop_na` and `select`

So we need to **select the columns we need first**:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g)
```

---

### `drop_na` and `select`

**Then** drop.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

---

### So let's try again

Please calculate the mean for each species and each sex, dropping missing data in the necessary columns first (first select, then drop missing values, then summarise by groups).

<br>

.center[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/programmer.png")
```

]

---

### Solution:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

---

### Note: If you continue, ungroup:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() #<<
```

---

### It's your go

Please calculate the **mean bill length and depth for all the available years for all species**.

<br>

.center[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/programmer.png")
```

]

---

### Solution:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, year, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) %>% 
  group_by(species, year) %>% 
  summarise(bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = T),
            bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = T))
```

Now it would be really nice to be able to compare from left to right, over time.

---

### Enter: `pivot_wider()`

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(year, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider( #<<
    names_from = year, # make this the column names #<<
    values_from = mean_body_mass # fill rows with these values #<<
    ) #<<
```

---

### The opposite: `pivot_longer()`

.scroll-output[

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(year, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, 
              values_from = mean_body_mass) %>% 
  pivot_longer(- species, # Don't pivot this column #<<
               names_to = "year", # Column for column headers #<<
               values_to = "mean_body_mass") %>% # Column for values #<<
  arrange(species) # sort descending: desc(species)
```

]

---

### Now everything together

We want to see the **percentage** of male or percentage of female penguins **for each species**. Here, pivoting wider will come in handy.

Please **`count` the numbers of penguins for each sex and species**. Then, **pivot wider to have sex as the column headers**. Make sure to **drop missing values in the two variables**. Tip: No grouping is necessary for `count`, just pass the two variables to the function.

With **`mutate`, you will be able to calculate the percentage**. Then use **`select` to remove unnecessary information**. (If you know it, you can use `transmute` as well.)

<br>

.center[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/programmer.png")
```

]

---

### Solution:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  select(sex, species) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  count(sex, species) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n) %>% 
  transmute(species,
            pct_male = male/(male + female))
```

Note: Using **`transmute` does the same as first mutating and then selecting**. It is a `mutate` and a `select` in **one single step**.
