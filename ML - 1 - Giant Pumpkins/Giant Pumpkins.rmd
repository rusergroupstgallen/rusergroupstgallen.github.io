# Background

> The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth's (GPC) mission cultivates the hobby of growing giant pumpkins throughout the world by establishing standards and regulations that ensure quality of fruit, fairness of competition, recognition of achievement, fellowship and education for all participating growers and weigh-off sites.

# Let's look at the files

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[training]

```{r}
training <- read_csv("./Data/training.csv")
```

This file will be used for training/fitting your model.

]

.panel[.panel-name[testing]

```{r}
holdout <- read_csv("./Data/holdout.csv")
```

This file will be used to make predictions on. There is no target variable in here, so there won't be data leakage during training. However, before submitting your predictions, please follow the sample submission format.

]

.panel[.panel-name[sample_submission]

```{r}
sample_submission <- read_csv("./Data/sample_submission.csv")
```

**Important**: Your submission to our email address must adhere to this format (CSV file).

The learning curve is always steep when looking at it from the bottom. Use the time later to ask your more experienced peers (or us) questions.

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable$

Make splits from the training first:

```{r}
dt_split <- initial_split(training)
dt_train <- training(dt_split)
dt_test <- testing(dt_split)

folds <- vfold_cv(dt_train, v = 5) # resampling for tuning
```

```{r}
dt_split
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

Let's fit a basic, linear regression with a penalty.

```{r}
lin_spec <- linear_reg(mixture = tune(), penalty = tune()) %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")
```

```{r}
lin_rec <- recipe(weight_kg ~ year + place + ott + est_weight + country,
                  data = training) %>%
  step_impute_mean(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_unknown(all_nominal_predictors(), new_level = "not specified") %>%    
  step_other(country, threshold = 0.03) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors(), one_hot = T) %>% 
  step_rm(country_other)
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

```{r}
lin_rec %>% prep() %>% juice()
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

.scroll-output[

```{r}
lin_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(lin_rec) %>%
  add_model(lin_spec)

lin_wf
```

]

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

Let's tune the penalty:

```{r}
lin_tune_results <- tune_grid(
  lin_wf,
  resamples = folds,
  grid = grid_regular(penalty(),
                      mixture(),
                      levels = 10)
)
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

.scroll-output[

Let's look at the results:

```{r}
lin_tune_results %>% 
  show_best(metric = "rsq")
```

]
---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

Let's finalise the model with the best parameters from tuning:

```{r}
lin_fit <- lin_wf %>% 
  finalize_workflow(select_best(lin_tune_results, metric = "rsq")) %>% 
  fit(dt_train)
```

Fitting onto the training split.

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

```{r}
lin_fit %>% 
  predict(dt_test)
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

```{r}
lin_fit %>% 
  augment(dt_test) %>% 
  rsq(truth = weight_kg, estimate = .pred)
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

Happy with that? Fit it on the entire training data provided and then make predictions for your final submission:

```{r}
final_model <- lin_wf %>% 
  finalize_workflow(select_best(lin_tune_results, metric = "rsq")) %>% 
  fit(training) #<<
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

.scroll-output[

Make predictions and save the results as _.csv_. Then submit your predictions to us and we will score them. You can submit as often as you like, and we'll give you information about your performance on the holdout, as we have the target values.

```{r}
final_model %>% 
  augment(holdout) %>% 
  select(id, .pred) %>% 
  rename(weight_kg = .pred)
```

]

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

.scroll-output[
```{r, dpi=300, out.width="100%", fig.height=4}
final_model %>% 
  augment(read_csv("./Data/holdout_with_target.csv", show_col_types = F)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(weight_kg, .pred)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_abline(lty = "dashed", colour = "red")
```
]

---

### You won't have the target variable on the holdout data set for two reasons

--

.pull-left[

.center[

**Reason 1:**

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/roll safe.png")
```
]

]

--

.pull-right[

.center[

**Reason 2:**

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/pumpkin spice.jpg")
```
]

]

There's something to win here - so play fair.

### Off you go

Have a look at our example for dealing with splits and hyperparameter tuning in the Tidymodels tutoring session. We'll be here for you to ask questions, once you get to it. Copying and pasting the code in the slides is **allowed**!

Spend as long as you need modelling.

#### ðŸ•’ 20:00

# That's it for today!

After our session: Watch videos from Julia Silge, Andrew Couch and David Robinson. Most importantly, have fun while learning.   

For further questions, feel free to reach out to us. Make sure to stay updated on our socials and via our website where all resources and dates are also published.
