The learning curve is always steep when looking at it from the bottom. Use the time later to ask your more experienced peers (or us) questions.

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

Let's fit a basic, linear regression.

```{r}
lin_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")
```

```{r}
lin_rec <- recipe(weight_lbs ~ year + place + ott + est_weight + country,
                  data = training) %>%
  step_impute_mean(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_unknown(all_nominal_predictors(), new_level = "not specified") %>%    
  step_other(country, threshold = 0.03) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors(), one_hot = T) %>% 
  step_rm(country_other)
```

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

```{r}
lin_rec %>% prep() %>% juice()
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

```{r}
lin_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(lin_rec) %>%
  add_model(lin_spec)

lin_wf
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

```{r}
lin_fit <- lin_wf %>% 
  fit(training)
```

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

```{r}
lin_fit %>% 
  augment(read_csv("./Data/holdout_with_target.csv", show_col_types = F)) %>% 
  rsq(truth = weight_lbs, estimate = .pred)
```

---

#### Our Basic Example: The ol' reliable

.scroll-output[
```{r, dpi=300, out.width="100%", fig.height=4}
lin_fit %>% 
  augment(read_csv("./Data/holdout_with_target.csv", show_col_types = F)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(weight_lbs, .pred)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_abline(lty = "dashed", colour = "red")
```

### You won't have the target variable on the holdout data set for two reasons

--

.pull-left[

.center[

**Reason 1:**

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/roll safe.png")
```
]

]

--

.pull-right[

.center[

**Reason 2:**

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/pumpkin spice.jpg")
```
]

]

There's something to win here - so play fair.

### Off you go

Have a look at our example for dealing with splits and hyperparameter tuning in the Tidymodels tutoring session. Copying and pasting the code in the slides is **allowed**!

Spend 30-45 min on getting started with your model. Ask your peers (that includes us) questions. 

#### ðŸ•’ 30-45 min

# That's it for today!

After our session: Read up documentation on the internet. Watch videos from Julia Silge, Andrew Couch and David Robinson. Submit your entries before the deadline to our email. And most importantly, have fun while learning.

For further questions, feel free to reach out to us. Make sure to stay updated on our socials and via our website where all resources and dates are also published.
