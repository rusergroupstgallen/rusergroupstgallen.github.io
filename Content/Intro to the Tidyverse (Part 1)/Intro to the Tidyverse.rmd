# Goals for this session

- Touch a little bit of everything by working live on a data set
- Know where to look for an answer if something is not immediately clear

Mastering the packages in the `tidyverse` alone takes years, it's completely normal to spend a large amount of time on stackoverflow looking for answers.

.center[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/stackoverflow meme.png")
```

# Let's get settled in

Installing and loading the `tidyverse` which in turn loads all packages contained in it:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r, warning=F, results=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's get the data and touch one of the first components of the `tidyverse` at the same time:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

```{r, warning=F, message=F, results=F}
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

# The Pipe: `%>%`

The pipe from the package `magrittr` can be translated into "take the thing from before and pipe it (put it) into what's coming after".

```{r}
penguins %>% summary()
```

---

# The Pipe: `%>%`

When working with many variables:

```{r}
penguins %>% glimpse()
```

---

# The Pipe: `%>%`

The pipe can make nested functions look much nicer and easier to read with the human eye. It will save you many headaches and is a major selling point.

Code summarising the mean body weight for the species _Adelie_ by island without the pipe ([Source](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/pipes/)):

```{r}
summarize(group_by(filter(penguins, species == "Adelie"), island), body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# The Pipe: `%>%`

The same code using the pipe can be read and produced line by line:

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Much simpler.

---

# Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

The `filter` function will give you back what you ask it for. You can think about it as "including" the observations matching your criterion. Note the lack of dollar signs.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  print(n = 5)
```
---

# Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

`filter` replaces the native R equivalent...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie",]
```

...and makes it part of pipe chain.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

---

# Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

Another neat trick: `%in%`. You can give the criterion more species.

It's your go, please filter this data set. We only want to see the species:

- Adelie
- Gentoo

Some guidance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Species 1 here", "Species 2 here"))
```

--

Solution:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Adelie", "Gentoo"))
```

---

# Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

How did I know which species are in the data set?

--

Using the `count` function, which is really useful for categorical variables:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(species, sort = T)
```

---

# Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

It's your go, please filter this data set. We only want to see the species:

- Adelie
- Gentoo

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Species 1 here", "Species 2 here"))
```

Solution:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Adelie", "Gentoo"))
```

There is actually another way here. We now know there are only three species in there.

---

# Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

So we could also frame it as: Filter for anything **but** Chinstrap. That's where the exclamation mark comes in, which is the `NOT` operator.

```{r}
TRUE
!TRUE
```

---

# Let's deconstruct that: `filter()`

Just put it before your condition:

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!species %in% c("Chinstrap"))
```

```{r, echo=F}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!species %in% c("Chinstrap")) %>% 
  print(n = 5)
```

---

# Coming back to the example

The goal is to calculate mean body mass for the species Adelie by island.

```{r, eval = F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# What's `group_by()`?

It unlocks the ability to calculate a number for different categories:

We have three islands. 

```{r}
penguins %>% count(island, sort = T)
```

---

# `group_by()` and `summarise()`

Just summarising without grouping gives the mean just for the species Adelie.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# `group_by()` and `summarise()`

Note that adding `na.rm = TRUE` is necessary to avoid running into errors when missing values are present. Observations with `NA` as values are discarded for the calculation, if `na.rm = TRUE` is specified.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

---

# `group_by()` and `summarise()`

So let's add it again. Now comes the magic. By adding the `group_by` argument, the value is calculated across all different islands.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

`summarise` reduces the number of rows.

---

# `mutate()`

Summarise collapsed the observations in each group for our calculations. If we want to preserve the same number of observations and add a new column containing a value for each existing value, we have to use `mutate`.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  mutate(species = "Adelie")
```

---

# It's your go

Please calculate the mean for each species and each island (as a combination). Tip: You can add more than one variable to the `group_by()` argument.

The NAs come from the `sex` variable.

```{r}

]

---

# `drop_na` and `select`

To solve this task, we need to take care of the `NA` values in the columns we are working with.

However, there is one problem:

_If we drop all rows with NA values in the whole data frame, we will delete too many rows!_

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
colSums(is.na(penguins)) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  rename(missing = x) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(missing, names %>% reorder(missing))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y = "Variable",
       x = "# of NAs")
```

---

# `drop_na` and `select`

So we need to select the columns we need first:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g)
```

---

# `drop_na` and `select`

**Then** drop.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

---

# So let's try again

Please calculate the mean for each species and each sex, dropping missing data in the necessary columns first.

--

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

---

# Note: If you continue, ungroup:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() #<<
```

---

# It's your go

Please calculate the mean bill length and depth over the available three years for all species.

<br>

.center[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GraphicsSlides/programmer.png")
```

]

---

#### Solution:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(year, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))
```

Now it would be really nice to be able to compare from left to right, over time.

---

# Enter: `pivot_wider()`

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(year, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year,#<<
              values_from = mean_body_mass)#<<
```

---

#### The opposite: `pivot_longer()`

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(year, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, 
              values_from = mean_body_mass) %>% 
  pivot_longer(- species,#<<
               names_to = "year",#<<
               values_to = "mean_body_mass") %>% #<<
  arrange(species) # sort descending: desc(species)
```

---

# One last time

We want to see the **percentage** of male or percentage of female penguins **for each species**. Here, pivoting wider will come in handy.

Please `count` the numbers of penguins for each sex and species. Then, pivot wider to have sex as the column headers. Make sure to drop missing values in the two variables. Tip: No grouping is necessary for `count`, just pass the two variables to the function.

With `mutate`, you will be able to calculate the percentage. Then use `select` to remove unnecessary information. (If you know it, you can use `transmute` as well.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}

---

#### Solution:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  select(sex, species) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  count(sex, species) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n) %>% 
  transmute(species,
            pct_male = male/(male + female))
```

Note: Using `transmute` does the same as first mutating and then selecting. It is a `mutate` and a `select` in one single step.
